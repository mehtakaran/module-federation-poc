# Package version discrepancy

This example demos a different lodash versions used in different apps.

- `app1` remote application.
- `app2` is the host application.

# Running Demo

Run `npm start`. This will build and serve both `app1` and `app2` on ports 3001 and 3002 respectively.

- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/) (REMOTE)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/) (HOST)
